            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">How accurate is the pricing data?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Our pricing data comes directly from hospitals and insurance companies as required 
              by federal transparency regulations. We update our database regularly to ensure 
              the most current information is available.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Is this data legally required to be published?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Yes, federal regulations require hospitals to publish their standard charges and 
              negotiated rates with insurance companies. This transparency rule went into effect 
              in January 2021.

            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Our data provides a good starting point for cost estimation, but your final bill 
              may vary based on your specific insurance plan, deductibles, and additional services. 
              Always confirm pricing with your provider before receiving care.
