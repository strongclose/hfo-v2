            HealthFees.org is your comprehensive resource for healthcare price transparency, 
            helping you make informed decisions about your medical care costs.

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            We believe healthcare pricing should be transparent and accessible to everyone. 
            Our platform aggregates and organizes pricing data from hospitals and insurers 
            to help you understand what you'll actually pay for medical procedures.
          </p>
          
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">How It Works</h2>
          <p>
            Government-mandated transparency rules require healthcare providers to publish 
            their prices, but this data is often scattered and difficult to understand. 
            We've organized it all in one searchable platform.
