                The percentage of costs of a covered healthcare service you pay after you've 
                paid your deductible. For example, if your coinsurance is 20%, you pay 20% 
                of each medical bill, and your health insurance pays 80%.

                The amount you owe for healthcare services before your health insurance begins to pay. 
                For example, if your deductible is $1,000, you must pay the first $1,000 of covered services.
